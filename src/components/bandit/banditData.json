We can get to the root with a cd / command. If we run a find command to search for the file size as we did last time, we will get many permission denied errors. We can remove these with the opperator -print 2>/dev/null.  This command essentially takes all permission denied errors and dumps them in a temporary and disposable file called dev/null to make our output be more legible.  This still doesnt help us much though because there are dozens of files on this server that are 33 bytes.  We can get more specific by using the -user and -group options to filter our search results.  This leaves us with only one file on the server matching our criteria, which we can then view to see our password."
